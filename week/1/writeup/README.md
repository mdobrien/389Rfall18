The auditor should alert his or her boss about the issues that were discovered. Problems do not get better with time. I donâ€™t think it is unethical to for the company to continue the release as planned, or with a slight delay. If it took six months to discover the vulnerabilities, it is likely that it will take hackers many months to find and exploit those flaws. In addition, there is always the risk of unknown vulnerabilities in the ECU. The manager should consider delaying the launch by a month or two this would give developers a leg up on attackers trying to compromise the system. It is likely that the update will be pushed out to the ECU units before attackers are able to exploit the code. As long as the issues are being handled as a top priority, I think this is an acceptable way to approach the problem.

The unethical, gray area is when the issues are pushed to the bottom of the pile because it is inconvenient, expensive, or a delay would hurt the stock. I believe this mentality is the biggest fundamental obstacle that needs to be overcome in order to solve the cyber security problem. Security is expensive and inconvenient at moment, and many companies would prefer to deal with the blowback of getting hacked as opposed to implementing expensive security measures.
